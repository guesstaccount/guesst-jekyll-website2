## listen to my music

i would prefer you listen to my music by [downloading it](xxx) and listening to it on your device of choice. if you can afford it, i would ask that you [pay whatever you think is reasonable](xxx) for the music to help me keep making it 🦋.

## philosophy

i believe in the potential for a [decentralized copyright free royalty system](https://youtu.be/PJSTFzhs1O4?si=LWINS-aeWHBl2Wb_) that does not rely on the ample number of middlemen currently required for people to consume art.

i believe that art consumers will support and appreciate art creators and that an economy of artists can exists without:
- streaming platforms that pay little to nothing using [blitzscaling](https://www.blitzscaling.com/) (derogatory) to create market dominance and force people into using inferior services or pay more for the "full version".

- predatory labels that keep the music industry in a chokehold.

- algorithms that limit creativity by prioritizing content that benefits a platform instead of allowing for authentic artist expression free from corporate meddling.
