<p><img src="https://files.guesst.net/file/guesst-files/blog/i-love-coding-screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of wilsons desktop" /></p>

<p>i guess if you don’t know what you are looking at you might not know why this feels so cool to me but what can you do.</p>

<p>there is something so limitless about it. i truly feel like i can accomplish anything that i want to. and especially with chatGPT, as long as i have the time and the desire to learn, i really can deploy any sort of application on the internet. im obviously primarily interested in static sites, but the fact that it doesn’t have to stop there is so inspiring to me.</p>

<p>honestly i need to cut this entry short so that i can clean my house before <a href="https://planet-home-jekyll-site.pages.dev/amateurs-club">amateurs club</a> tonight. iykyk</p>

<p>ofc i was initially, very pissed off and violated and angry feeling… but the longer i sat in bed and stewed, the more i turned to sadness. i have been thinking often lately about the injustice of the world and how i get to have things that many people just never even remotely consider to be a possibility for themself.</p>

<p>i am <em>incredibly</em> privileged. and im not tryna say this in some middle class guilt kinda way, but more in like a gratitude and rededication towards my values and making the world better kind of way.</p>

<p>to be real, for about 20 minutes i just kept thinking about how i wanted to reach out to the people that stole them and have a conversation. im not even rly sure how much i would be able to help – obviously this is an issue that isn’t going to end with a one time donation etc. – but yeah i just rly wanted to understand / gain more insight.</p>

<p>now im at cafe allez. its beautiful here. im grateful for the friends i have made who work here, for the ability for me to come here with my computer and make a lofi beat, get some work done, generally just look around and see the beauty in the world.</p>

<p>heres a pic of me doin that:

<p>my partner wants to go get new wheels and stuff right now so im gonna sign off. might be back later to add to this post, but who knows! im just getting back into this stuff :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[i woke up today to my partner and i’s wheels stolen off our bikes.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">guesst // dont let me go (Aggressive Lifeboat wkris6.2.als)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/07/05/dont-let-me-go.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="guesst // dont let me go (Aggressive Lifeboat wkris6.2.als)" /><published>2024-07-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-07-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/07/05/dont-let-me-go</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/07/05/dont-let-me-go.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="listen" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">guesst // scattered</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/05/22/scattered.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="guesst // scattered" /><published>2024-05-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-05-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/05/22/scattered</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/05/22/scattered.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="listen" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">guesst // granada id</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/05/04/granada-id.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="guesst // granada id" /><published>2024-05-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-05-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/05/04/granada-id</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/05/04/granada-id.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="listen" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">guesst // fmSMATE</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/04/10/fmSMATE.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="guesst // fmSMATE" /><published>2024-04-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-04-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/04/10/fmSMATE</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/04/10/fmSMATE.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="listen" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">guesst // holding me tight</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/03/15/holding-me-tight.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="guesst // holding me tight" /><published>2024-03-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-03-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/03/15/holding-me-tight</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/listen/2024/03/15/holding-me-tight.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="listen" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">new logo! familiar lessons</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/02/19/new-logo-familiar-lessons.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="new logo! familiar lessons" /><published>2024-02-19T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-02-19T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/02/19/new-logo-familiar-lessons</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/02/19/new-logo-familiar-lessons.html"><![CDATA[<p>hi!</p>

<p>its been a week. been djing a lot, im in a band now (more info when we’re prepared to drop), working on a bunch of music collaborations, outsourced some help on show visuals, finally building a website for <a href="https://planethome.media">planethome.media</a> (under construction as of writing this). all stuff that i am really excited to work on, but im def feeling a bit stressed to get it all done.</p>

<p>i will say the good thing abt stress is that i feel like i am a pretty capable person so when shit starts going wild, i feel maybe a bit chaotic, but ultimately i always pull through and i have a fucking fantastic community that i can lean on to get stuff done too. thats a real blessing, to have ppl who you can share the load with.</p>

<p>one really awesome side effect of all these things im working on is i took the time to really look at my logo and refine it a bit. heres what i came up with:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/guesst-logo-2024.svg" alt="guesst logo" /></p>

<p>rn i cant figure out a way to make that any smaller so sorry if it takes up your whole screen.</p>

<p>one thing i kept worrying about during the process of making this was that i was gonna make the wrong decision and be “stuck” with my current logo. oh word, like how i am “stuck” with my current logo? crazy because i just replaced it on my website and now im not stuck. wild how that works.</p>

<p>snark aside, just want to put a reminder here for myself and for everyone else who reads this that art has no rules. branding has rules, but i want my branding to be art… which has no rules. so by proxy, branding has no rules. fuck yeah. lawyered.</p>

<p>speaking of the “process” of making this thing, check out all the different variations of this fuckin thing i made:</p>

<p><img src="https://files.guesst.net/file/guesst-files/blog/guesst-logo-2024-iteration-screenshot.jpeg" alt="a screenshot of wilsons desktop. featured prominently is the design software 'affinity designer' with a document full of a bunch of iterations of the guesst logo." /></p>

<p>and yes i absolutely studied skrillexs logos to figure out what i like in a logo, its important to take inspiration from things u like! one of of my fav quotes i came across recently is “copy your idols: you arent good enough at copying to make it the same, and so you will accidentally make something original in the process.”</p>

<p>i think thats all for now. listening to this song rn:</p>
