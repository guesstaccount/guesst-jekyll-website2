<p>hi!</p>

<p>its been a week. been djing a lot, im in a band now (more info when we’re prepared to drop), working on a bunch of music collaborations, outsourced some help on show visuals, finally building a website for <a href="https://planethome.media">planethome.media</a> (under construction as of writing this). all stuff that i am really excited to work on, but im def feeling a bit stressed to get it all done.</p>

<p>i will say the good thing abt stress is that i feel like i am a pretty capable person so when shit starts going wild, i feel maybe a bit chaotic, but ultimately i always pull through and i have a fucking fantastic community that i can lean on to get stuff done too. thats a real blessing, to have ppl who you can share the load with.</p>

<p>one really awesome side effect of all these things im working on is i took the time to really look at my logo and refine it a bit. heres what i came up with:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/guesst-logo-2024.svg" alt="guesst logo" /></p>

<p>rn i cant figure out a way to make that any smaller so sorry if it takes up your whole screen.</p>

<p>one thing i kept worrying about during the process of making this was that i was gonna make the wrong decision and be “stuck” with my current logo. oh word, like how i am “stuck” with my current logo? crazy because i just replaced it on my website and now im not stuck. wild how that works.</p>

<p>snark aside, just want to put a reminder here for myself and for everyone else who reads this that art has no rules. branding has rules, but i want my branding to be art… which has no rules. so by proxy, branding has no rules. fuck yeah. lawyered.</p>

<p>speaking of the “process” of making this thing, check out all the different variations of this fuckin thing i made:</p>

<p><img src="https://files.guesst.net/file/guesst-files/blog/guesst-logo-2024-iteration-screenshot.jpeg" alt="a screenshot of wilsons desktop. featured prominently is the design software 'affinity designer' with a document full of a bunch of iterations of the guesst logo." /></p>

<p>and yes i absolutely studied skrillexs logos to figure out what i like in a logo, its important to take inspiration from things u like! one of of my fav quotes i came across recently is “copy your idols: you arent good enough at copying to make it the same, and so you will accidentally make something original in the process.”</p>

<p>i think thats all for now. listening to this song rn:</p>
