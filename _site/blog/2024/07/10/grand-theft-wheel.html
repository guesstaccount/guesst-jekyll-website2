<p>i woke up today to my partner and i’s wheels stolen off our bikes.</p>

<p>ofc i was initially, very pissed off and violated and angry feeling… but the longer i sat in bed and stewed, the more i turned to sadness. i have been thinking often lately about the injustice of the world and how i get to have things that many people just never even remotely consider to be a possibility for themself.</p>

<p>i am <em>incredibly</em> privileged. and im not tryna say this in some middle class guilt kinda way, but more in like a gratitude and rededication towards my values and making the world better kind of way.</p>

<p>to be real, for about 20 minutes i just kept thinking about how i wanted to reach out to the people that stole them and have a conversation. im not even rly sure how much i would be able to help – obviously this is an issue that isn’t going to end with a one time donation etc. – but yeah i just rly wanted to understand / gain more insight.</p>

<p>now im at cafe allez. its beautiful here. im grateful for the friends i have made who work here, for the ability for me to come here with my computer and make a lofi beat, get some work done, generally just look around and see the beauty in the world.</p>

<p>heres a pic of me doin that:

<p>my partner wants to go get new wheels and stuff right now so im gonna sign off. might be back later to add to this post, but who knows! im just getting back into this stuff :)</p>
