<p>i deleted all my social media in december of 2023 because it was killing my brain and making me hate myself. before i deleted my socials i started blogging because i have always been fascinated with the original web 2 infrastructure and the concept of un conglomerated sharing. i have continued that process and i make posts which you can read / watch / look at here.</p>

<p>this is not the full list of all of my posts. it is kinda taxing to convert them all from my previous website to my new one because i switched from writing my whole website in static html to building my site with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> at the suggestion of my awesome friend <a href="https://jelias.me/">jacob</a>!</p>

<p>in the mean time you can see my old old posts (formally called biproducts) by visiting <a href="https://playful-elf-104234.netlify.app/biproduct/biproductindex">this archive site</a> i created to memorialize the work i did on my first site.</p>
