# my thoughts on rates
many people ask me what my rate is for various creative work, and often when i get that question i feel somewhat silly because i know how i want to answer it but its a rather complex web of feelings and its not nearly so simple as a single hourly rate. below i have catalogued some of those feelings so that each of my clients can feel informed and understand my perspective and philosophy about being paid for my work.

tl;dr, it depends heavily on the project, the relationship, and the financial standing of the client.

## to free or not to free
in a perfect world, i would have infinite time and never charge for my work. i believe that making art is sacred and the bond that people make when building something together is payment in and of itself for the work, but of course we live in a capitalist world and all of us have to make choices about where to spend our time and how that relates to our ability to continue to afford persistence in this world. 

as someone who makes my living off my art and my work on other peoples art, i know at a certain point i need to charge, but i believe that point is different for every project and every client. 

## time vs liquidity
the first part of the equation to discover how much a project rate should be is to calculate my availability to jump on a project in the first place. this can pretty much always be determined by the amount of time and liquidity i have. liquidity, in this case, is how much money i have and by extension how effectively i am setting myself up to continue doing this creative work.

## value prop or skills trade
next, we must determine if there is any indirectly realized value that should be calculated. this can take many forms. most commonly with music work this takes the shape of a **skills trade** or a **split**. a skills trade is like if i do mixing or production work for one artist and in turn they help me write a missing verse on my song. for splits, this is like if an artist has a particularly big following, i might opt to choose to get a percentage of the revenue of the song as opposed to an upfront cost. with a split tho, we have to be realistic about what value will actually be recouped. for developing artists, often times its unlikely that a split will ever cover the cost of what the rate would have been if calculated by time worked.
## sliding scale
for the last part of the equation, we need to determine the liquidity of the client. i believe in sliding scale pricing structures. simply put, if you are not making a ton of money, u should pay less. if you are making a ton of money, u should pay more.

## goal numbers
ok so yeah, thats a lot of theory, but we're still sitting here like...

below are some types of work that i can and would do for people and some rates that would help me live a comfortable life. if you make hella coin, do not see these as bargain prices, and if u dont have any money, do not see these as barriers to entry. these are just some starting points for conversations. 
### music
- **mixing:** *$1000 per song*
- **mastering:** *$200 per song*
- **production:** *$500 per session*
- **full stack (start to finish all inclusive):** *$2000 per song*

### design
- **album art:** *$100 per cover art*
- **show poster:** *$100 per poster* 

make me an offer. worst i can say is no! :)
