# guesst is a dj

i have experience with open format, dubstep, house, techno, drum & bass (favorite genre rn ðŸ˜Š), and more. i have recently been experimenting with hybrid ableton/dj sets. i am well acquainted with standard club setup, but i prepare and play on any hardware, as well as bring my own if needed.

# guesst is a live performer

when i first started the guesst project, i felt conflicted: should i focus on dj centered dance music or write pop music and other vocal/songwriting centric genres? i decided to go with... both. you can expect a guesst vocal performance show to have 100% original works in at least six genres.
