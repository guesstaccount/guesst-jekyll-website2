# never guessed that i'd spend energy on being small

![](https://files.guesst.net/file/guesst-files/album-art/never%20guessed%20that%20i%27d%20spend%20energy%20on%20being%20small.jpg)

thank you so much for coming to my little party! im grateful to have such wonderful friends with whom i can share in my excitement for my art. this album meant a great deal to me at the time, and in a lot of ways serves as a mile marker of a distinct era of my self exploration. particiularly as it pertains to "setting me up" for my current DIDT chicago era. 

thank you for being here.

## not coming back, not far enough

![](https://files.guesst.net/file/guesst-files/album-art/not-coming-back-not-far-enough-album-art4.jpeg)

they had finally heard it one too many times today. being misgendered is never fun, but especially when it's by somebody close to you, it's hard to let that go.

"im going on a walk."

they walked out to the beach, kicking their toes in the cold wet pacific sand and holding back tears as they begged the ocean to deafen their thoughts. if they focused hard enough on the sound of the crashing waves, they just might be able to shake the feeling that they would never be seen as they are.

"i'm not coming back here." they thought. "i'm not far enough yet."

### LYRICS //

take my shirt off, throw it on the floor  
stare down the mirror longer than before  
never guessed that i’d spend energy on being small  
shed my astro persona check it at the door  

had it figured out when studded belts were cool  
had it figured out if only then i knew  

not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  

not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  

i got too much shit rattling around inside my head  
remember nights of headphones sleeping at my desk  
i want to feel what it was like  
to be in love and one track minded  
whats even worse i realize  
that i can feel that any time  

but i don’t  
its all in my control  
but i don't  
please help me to unfold  

not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  

not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  
not comin' back, not far enough  

## kinda ugly

![](https://files.guesst.net/file/guesst-files/album-art/kinda-ugly-cover2.jpeg)

i wrote this whole ass song in washington square park and central park while living out of an airbnb in nyc after i didn't resign my lease. kinda fun, learned a lot. was sad tho too lol.

### LYRICS //

i feel  
kinda ugly  
all the tiktok kids got me crumblin'  
know its vain  
know im buggin'  
all my friends say that im lovely  

i feel  
kinda ugly  
all the tiktok kids got me crumblin'  
know its vain  
know im buggin'  
all my friends say that im lovely  

take a look where i’m at  
a clearing yellow and black  
i’ve got my life on my back  
don’t know when im comin' back  

lights of the city keep track  
of how much juice i got  
batttery at 20%  
i guess i should start  

walkin' is the library open  
i don't want to sleep yet  
i wish i could level my head  
keep thinking i lack  
a pretty face with the eyelash  
hold it in higher regard then my brain or my kindness  

i miss feelin like i was good enough them  
temporary but sometimes it kinda felt like confidence  
partnership a bandaid for me cause i got some toxic things  
that i've drilled into my skull everyday again and again and again and again  

wish i was not so insecure  
wish i could taste the love im near  
when i know this self hate is manufactured  
keep me feeling fractured we all burn  

ive been trained  
to feel ugly  
all the tiktok kids make 'em money  
im not saved  
im still learning  
but everyday i work on somethin'  

(beautiful)  
on my back in the park  
lookin up into the stars  
(as you are)  
its midday but they are there  
just like the beauty we are  

(beautiful)  
if you don't see it today  
if you don't see it tomorrow  
(as you are)  
keep surrounding urself  
with those with whom you belong  

i feel  
kinda ugly  
all the tiktok kids got me crumblin'  
know its vain  
know im buggin'  
all my friends say that im lovely  

i feel  
kinda ugly  
all the tiktok kids got me crumblin'  
know its vain  
know im buggin'  
all my friends say that im lovely  

## body image

![](https://files.guesst.net/file/guesst-files/album-art/body-image-album-art.jpeg)

dude im not even gonna lie i feel like i keep trying to write my thoughts into songs in ways that can help me make progress on myself and tbh it just feels like i keep doing great work for myself and then it all just comes crashing down.

whats even more offensive is that this song is LITERALLY about how you have to keep learning the lessons over and over again. in fact most of my music is about that right now. "goddamnit will i have to do this daily"

ah well. i hope you like it.

### LYRICS //

wake up check my texts snooze knock out again  
alarm stop this time ig dms  
spend half an hour on the clock app trends  
now i wish that i could look like them  

two hours i finally get out of bed  
trapped in the bathroom with my reflection  
a staring contest that i wont win  

taking steps to love the physicality  
that i will be embodying  
goddamnit will i have to do this daily?  

making habits don’t forget to brush my teeth  
moving my body making beats  
goddamnit will i have to do this daily?  

im far enough along  
but not quite enough to not be writing songs  
im insecure but keeping on  
i hope that i’ll keep going strong  

im far enough along  
(but not quite enough) to not be writing songs  
insecure but keeping on  
i hope that i’ll keep going strong  

wake up different bed but the same damn dreams  
alarms off fuck shit its almost three  
spent half the day catching up on zzzs  
just to stumble out onto the street  

convinced im dying im all washed up  
cant build a brand no one gives to fuck  
learning i need to make my own love  
but most days shit is kitchy and dumb  

taking steps to love the physicality  
that i will be embodying  
goddamnit will i have to do this daily?  

making habits don’t forget to brush my teeth  
moving my body making beats  
goddamnit will i have to do this daily?  

im far enough along  
but not quite enough to not be writing songs  
im insecure but keeping on  
i hope that i’ll keep going strong  

im far enough along  
(but not quite enough) to not be writing songs  
insecure but keeping on  
i hope that i’ll keep going strong  

i hope that i’ll keep going strong  
i hope that i’ll keep going strong  
i hope that i’ll keep going strong  
i hope that i’ll keep going strong  

## 23 not famous

![](https://files.guesst.net/file/guesst-files/album-art/23-not-famous-album-art2.jpeg)

### LYRICS //

scrolling through and endless time suck  
entertainment got my mind fucked  
persistently insisting that the others are the default  

avoid eye contact w the clock  
im embarrassed but i cant stop  
comparing myself tearing me apart because im  

23 not famous  
i cant help but envy them  
its not it he said  

cant help it im jealous  
they so pretty in my head  
they’re in my head  

23 not famous  
i cant help but envy them  
its not it he said  

cant help it im jealous  
they so pretty in my head  
they’re in my head  

select a face faking magic for metas grace  
im fading every time i sell my waiting to fake fame  
been debating deactivating daily  
undeleting im sorry  
just gotta upload a story  
feed pulls me in and im hungry  

a decade of selling my goals  
to a corporation that wants to keep my eye on the glow  
ud think id know that i have to let it go  
but i forget for a minute and fucking redownload cause im  

23 not famous  
i cant help but envy them  
its not it he said  

cant help it im jealous  
they so pretty in my head  
they’re in my head  

23 not famous  
i cant help but envy them  
its not it he said  

cant help it im jealous  
they so pretty in my head  
they’re in my head  

23 not famous  
i cant help but envy them  

cant help it im jealous  
they so pretty in my head  

23 not famous  
i cant help but envy them  

cant help it im jealous  
they so pretty in my head  
they’re in my head  

## status on fling

vague emotional descriptions and feelings and moments about my ex and how it interplayed w my reality when i was nomadic for a year and learning to be a better version of myself.

this song almost didn't get finished -- it was buried on my external hard drive (yeah i literally removed it from my computer) because i thought it wasn't gonna go anywhere.

when @jacquesdebar and i were figuring out what tracks felt right for the narrative of the album we had cut a previous contender and were looking for one last track to bridge the beginning and end sections of the album.

status on fling was a weird demo i had thrown together in about five minutes and then sent a quick render to @ndr_xpsd a few months prior. you can hear in the opening sample that when we were next in the same space i was trying to workshop some more lyrics to it, but even then it didn't feel like it was ever going to get finished -- more like just a fun writing exercise.

fast forward and we're in jacques apartment trying to fill this narrative hole and nothing quite feels right and we have gone through every demo on my computer -- but not the demos not on my computer. >:)

### LYRICS //

and what you said it still rings  
right between my earholes  
you set the status on fling  
do i even need more  

i’ve been swept up in this stream  
and im reaching for anything to hold  

thought we were on the same team  
when did we start to keep score  
i’ll be the fret to your string  
you know i wanted more i  

melt down  
waiting for the chance to make it right  

i never wanted this  
and what you said it still rings  
right between my earholes  
you set the status on fling  
do i even need more  
oh i never wanted this  
melt down  
waiting for the chance to make it right  

## 222

you know that movie "tick tick boom?" its like a lin manuel miranda netflix adaptation of a musical by the dude that wrote the broadway musical "rent".

i had just watched that movie and as a result of the beautiful hollywood lovestoriness, i couldn't stop thinking about my ex relationship.

there i was on the bleachers of glendale highschool walking back and forth thinking that my life was somehow incomplete cause i hadn't fulfilled this western social imperative of heterosexual relationship success. also, neither me nor my ex are cisgender so heterosexuality is just not something either of us can ever achieve which made it all the more frustrating that my brain. wouldnt. shut. UP!!!

i left the track trying to channel my frustration and despondence into something creative. i pulled open my voice memos and just started humming shit and trying to mouth words.

i've been an angel numbers bitch for a while, but it really started to lock in when steven and i lived together nearly a year ago. i was walking and humming and saw a 222 on the license plate of a car. i knew it was gonna be okay.

### LYRICS //

i used to know what love looked like  
now i worry that its clouding up my mind  
not really sure if we can make things right  
not friends just awkward and polite  

oooohh  
oooohh  

we’re in the same place  
first time in what feels like a decade  
a year point 5 maybe its just fate  
to see you before you fly home to your state  
the theatre is eggin me on  

7 facetime calls  
i dont feel less nervous at all  
on the bleachers pacing  
my head is racing  
but im done chasing you and  

i  
saw the 222 on the license plate im doin  
fine  
hit the the dnd it’ll have to wait cause  
i don’t miss walkin back myself just to  
fit in the arms of someone else i know ill be  
fine  
trust a 222 and im on my way  

and im still chewing on the awkwardness that bridges me to you  
another weird night  

you’re right, i knew  
i’d never lie to you  

with you around im anxious  
but if you were gone id hate this  

i  
saw the 222 on the license plate im doin  
fine  
hit the the dnd it’ll have to wait  
cause  
i don’t miss walkin back myself just to  
fit in the arms of someone else i know ill be  
fine  
trust a 222 and im on my way  

i  
saw the 222 on the license plate im doin  
fine  
hit the the dnd it’ll have to wait  
cause  
i don’t miss walkin back myself just to  
fit in the arms of someone else i know ill be  
fine  
trust a 222 and im on my way  

## taste of a sin

there's this person who i can't stop writing songs about.

i had spent the better part of two years trying to forget them entirely -- trying to get them out of my head. it wasn't working, and i was fighting for no reason. we started trying to reconnect. i was scared about what that could mean.

i knew that the time i had spent alone working on myself had put me in a position to be the best version of myself i had ever known, and i was scared to lose that. but i also knew that i had to admit that i still missed them.

### LYRICS //

im farther than i’ve ever been  
but i still miss the skin  
of a world where your in it  
a purple and nylon beginning  
the taste of a sin  
i’m forgetting the ending  

im farther than i’ve ever been  
but i still miss the skin  
of a world where your in it  
a purple and nylon beginning  
the taste of a sin  
i’m forgetting the ending  

tungsten light try to hide my long face  
never fight but i guess we lost faith  
6 hour flight just to feel your embrace  
mad unlikely but do you think we might  
have another night  
caught my tongue still dunno that id be alright  
u would be alright  
am i in my light?  
or a rembrandt am i codependent? i can’t win  

half in half black out on a grey couch  
maxed it purple matches burn or drown it out  
actin’ can’t imagine how to live aloud  
none of these people looking down im feeling threatened now  
hot notes in the moments they keep me from  
goin all beach ball frozen  
these patterns i know them  
my breath controlled to keep me out of a hole  
but if there’s one thing i know its  

im farther than i’ve ever been  
but i still miss the skin  
of a world where your in it  
a purple and nylon beginning  
the taste of a sin  
i’m forgetting the ending  

im farther than i’ve ever been  
but i still miss the skin  
of a world where your in it  
a purple and nylon beginning  
the taste of a sin  
i’m forgetting the ending  

## grey in all directions

marco and jay were walking jay's dog jorja at the west hollywood dog park by the library.

i couldn't even tell you why i slipped into dissociative emptiness that day. everything was going pretty great to the outside observer.

but then i became an outside observer to my own self. i had dissociated previously but i was always kinda wrapped up in a larger scope of anxiety and depression so i didn't really have a clear boundaried quantifiable experience of dissociation until this day.

but yeah... there my body was staring out the huge beautiful glass windows of the west hollywood library. and i wasn't in me. my body was a shell, except it had forgotten how to do anything short of continue breathing. i remember banging on my own pane of glass within my head -- "let me out! let me back into myself! i want to feel!!" but there was nothing. i had been robbed of my consciousness, and at present it felt there was no way to get it back.

jay and marco sheparded me home, and then jay put a guitar in my hands. literally, like shaped my hands around his guitar. he and marco knew something was up, but they didn't really know how to help.

the guitar was like a waterfall first trickling then bursting out of a solid glacier. i felt myself again and i was overcome with everythingness.

this song wrote itself in about 11 minutes. i then played it for jay and marco, and then played it "one more time for the voice memo just so i don't forget anything".

### LYRICS //

the observation deck of  
your own experience  
its grey in all directions  

hey dude get out your head  
you’re just staring down again  
come on lets find the exit  

10 minutes im dead  
yall walk i descend  
im sick of being that friend  

10 minutes again  
choke a laugh and then  
a chill return im frozen  

fuck myself im never past this  
odd end jobs like a z list actress  
grey in all directions  
its grey in all directions  

call it quits prepare my casket  
overblessed ill never last its  
grey in all directions  
its always grey  

second guessing every thought that i had locked in  
i got my systems keepin me up from dusk to  
dinner time its 3am  
its not my fault im taking in  
whats everywhere and never again  
a beauty im in or incapable of  
seeing it when i know that its  
all about around within  
the joy is yours if you let it in  
but i see the corners fading  
fuck its starting again  

fuck myself im never past this  
odd end jobs like a z list actress  
grey in all directions  
its grey in all directions  

call it quits prepare my casket  
overblessed ill never last its  
grey in all directions  

10 minutes im dead  
yall talk, i descend  
im fucking sick of being that friend  

on and on im never past this  
glimpse of pink try to make it last  
its grey in all directions  
its always grey  

## sunlit tomb

i wrote this song one day after my worst day of the summer.  

i had one of those days where absolutely every one of my failsafes to pull me out of a bad moment had failed or only kept my desolation at bay for a few flimsy minutes.  

this song is about having that feeling of complete despair when everything around u is perfect and you couldn't ask for a better life.  

### LYRICS //

four eight foot windows in this room  
sunlight still spilling in my tomb  
why does it have to feel so pitiful so all consuming  
hate knowing i refuse to bloom  

9 facetime outgoing  
spend thirty hours crumbling  
my face contorts pls don’t perceive me  
stretchy cage im shallow breathing  

## 50 thousand times

### LYRICS //

i fall over 50 thousand times a day  
head in hands why cant the learning learn to stay  
all ive been informs who i think i’ll be  
try to remember who i wanna be is all for me  

sitting alone in someone elses home and i  
cant leave until i charge my phone and i  
know that every day i grow but can  
we acknowledge that it sucks that this shit works so slow  

indecisive the path im supposed to take  
ive been told good things come to those who wait  
but im so antsy my laptops only at 33  
patience a virtue thats completely lost on me  

sitting alone in someone elses home and i  
cant leave until i charge my phone and i  
know that every day i grow  
but in half an hour ill forget thats something that i know  

alone in every place i go but i  
cant leave my story half untold and i  
know that everyday i grow but can  
we acknowledge that it sucks that this shit works so slow  
can we acknowledge that it sucks that this shit works so slow  

im not alone in all the things i know and  
i cant believe that 50 thousand notes could  
keep me afloat when i get down too low  
its good to know that every day i grow
