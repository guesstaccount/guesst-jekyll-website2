i woke up today to my partner and i's wheels stolen off our bikes. 

ofc i was initially, very pissed off and violated and angry feeling... but the longer i sat in bed and stewed, the more i turned to sadness. i have been thinking often lately about the injustice of the world and how i get to have things that many people just never even remotely consider to be a possibility for themself. 

i am _incredibly_ privileged. and im not tryna say this in some middle class guilt kinda way, but more in like a gratitude and rededication towards my values and making the world better kind of way.

to be real, for about 20 minutes i just kept thinking about how i wanted to reach out to the people that stole them and have a conversation. im not even rly sure how much i would be able to help -- obviously this is an issue that isn't going to end with a one time donation etc. -- but yeah i just rly wanted to understand / gain more insight. 

now im at cafe allez. its beautiful here. im grateful for the friends i have made who work here, for the ability for me to come here with my computer and make a lofi beat, get some work done, generally just look around and see the beauty in the world. 

heres a pic of me doin that:
