i have been having an absolute blast the past few days coding :)

it is SOO fun to me! i mean just look at this:

i guess if you don't know what you are looking at you might not know why this feels so cool to me but what can you do.

there is something so limitless about it. i truly feel like i can accomplish anything that i want to. and especially with chatGPT, as long as i have the time and the desire to learn, i really can deploy any sort of application on the internet. im obviously primarily interested in static sites, but the fact that it doesn't have to stop there is so inspiring to me.

honestly i need to cut this entry short so that i can clean my house before [amateurs club](https://planet-home-jekyll-site.pages.dev/amateurs-club) tonight. iykyk
